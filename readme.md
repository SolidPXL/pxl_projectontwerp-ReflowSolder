Final exam project for the PXL course 'Project Ontwerp' (Translated 'Project design')

The goal was to design a product from start to finish and make a first prototype version and to present our project in front of our professors. We got scored on our PCB design, Case design, project pitch, documentation and our development during the project.


The project is inspired by the AfterEarth [Solder Reflow plate](GitHub - AfterEarthLTD/Solder-Reflow-Plate: PCB based SMD reflow plates](https://github.com/AfterEarthLTD/Solder-Reflow-Plate/tree/main)



V1 is what was submitted for points. Plans are to fix the issues that have been found and release a V2
